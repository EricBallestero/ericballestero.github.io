        <p>From the Greek “<i>meta</i>” (beyond) and the Latin “<i>materia</i>” (matter, material), a metamaterial is a composite structure that is engineered in a way to obtain extraordinary
          physical properties compared to typical matter. In other words, they obtain their physical properties from the specific arrangement of the structure elements (at a macroscopic level),
          rather than from the molecular arrangement of the constituting matter (microscopic level), like the difference in density between foam and plastic. Metamaterials can exhibit non-classical physical properties,
          such as negative refraction index (inversion of the wave propagation path at an interface) or negative bulk modulus (shrinking of the matter instead of expanding when being compressed). 
          Generally, such structures allow to work with waves that are much larger than the metamaterial elements, resulting in much smaller designs than traditional alternatives.</p>
          <p>By affecting the fundamental parameters of wave propagation, acoustic
          metamaterials can be engineered to transmit, reflect, trap, or amplify mechanical
          waves at certain frequencies in gas, liquid or solid media. As such, acoustic metamaterials come in a variety of shapes for many wave control applications, going
          from cloaking to trapping or imaging, with scales ranging from ultrasonic to seismic wavelengths.</p>

        <p>In physics, the description of a phenomenon is usually achieved through a general
          theoretical formulation that models some sort of dynamic system, e.g., pressure
          and velocity variations in one or more dimensions in acoustics. Such formulation
          often takes the form of a Partial Differential Equation (PDE). For the majority
          of cases, it is dauntingly difficult to use these theoretical formulations to describe
          the state of the variables in the entire domain considered due to the complexity
          in the mathematical formulation, which usually describes the variables under consideration
          through partial derivatives at each point of space and time. Instead,
          approximations to these equations can be made, simplifying the analytical problem
          based on a set of assumptions.</p>
          <p>One useful approximation is that of discretization, where the space and time
            continuum are discretized into small and finite elements. Writing the differential
            equations in a discretized state allows a numerical formulation that can be practically
            used in order to obtain the values of the dependent variables given a certain
            set of initial conditions. The nature of the numerical scheme then depends on
            the discretization method being employed. FEM is one of two most common approaches
            that are used when numerically solving a PDE in the frequency domain,
            often compared to its boundary equivalent, the Boundary Element Method (BEM). 
            Of course, other numerical schemes can be designed to work in the
            time-domain rather than the frequency domain, such as Finite-Difference Time-
            Domain (FDTD).</p>

        <h3 style="color:rgb(170, 92, 46);">Biomedical ultrasound applications</h3>
        <img width="450px" style="vertical-align:top; float: right; margin: 0 0 0 40px" src="assets/img/UAD_Concept.png" alt="..." />
        <p>Research in ultrasounds is generally focused around
          biomedical applications, such as medical imaging and non-invasive
          controlled medical therapy. These applications can
          allow (i) to better visualize internal organs to identify with
          precision therapy targets, e.g., ultrasensitive Doppler imaging
          (uDoppler) or ultrasound localisation microscopy (ULM),
          and (ii), to treat such narrow organ regions with non-invasive
          localized ultrasonic fields, e.g., wave field manipulation with
          beam steering/focusing which can be combined with High
          Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) for heat-induced
          tissue ablation.</p>
        <p>Over the past decades, the use of acoustic holograms,
            and therefore acoustic lenses, has been a key research element
            to replace expensive multi-transducer settings and allow
            even further possibilities in controlling the propagating ultrasonic
            wavefields, e.g., increasing spatial imaging resolution
            with compressive wavefield encoding/sensing and/or generating
            arbitrary ultrasonic fields for complex medical therapies. 
            The idea behind acoustic lenses is that the phase and
            amplitude distribution of a desired wavefront can be spatially
            encoded into a monolithic element and then reproduced when the 
            structure is being radiated by a wavefield.</p>

        <img width="450px" style="vertical-align:middle; float: right; margin:0 0 0 40px " src="assets/img/AVR.png" alt="..." />
        <p>The ability to create computer models, based on real or imaginary environments, has been evolving
          at an extraordinarily fast pace for the past decades. Computer Aided Design (CAD) software and
          new user-machine interfaces have played a major role in developing easier and faster means to build
          virtual environments with increasing realism. Alongside the latter, computer processing capabilities
          for undertaking acoustic calculations have been rapidly expanding, allowing faster and more efficient
          deterministic calculations of the emulated physics’ behaviour inside computer models. In acoustics, 
          we can use computers to calculate how the sound propagates in an environment, an information which can then be 
          manipulated in order to reproduce the sensation of hearing inside any given scenary.</p>
        <p>Nowadays, the technique being
          commonly used to prospectively share the hypothetical auditory sensation of some acoustic space
          is called auralisation, i.e., the process of rendering audio data through binaural synthesis by digital
          means to achieve a virtual reconstruction of the sound field at a given position. Tools such as video game engines and
          Virtual Reality (VR) can be incredibly useful in processing the information and delivering it in a realistic fashion.</p>

        <p>Knowledge dissemination is an important part of the scientific endeavour. This activity can take many forms: workshops, seminars, videos, exhibitions, etc. 
          The main objective is to synthesise the state-of-the-art research and accumulated knwoledge in one or many scientific fields and deliver it to a general public, i.e., 
          schools, towns, journal channels, or other scientific peers which might not be proficient on the specific topic being disseminated. Research would not be very useful process
          if it stayed into a researcher's book!</p>
