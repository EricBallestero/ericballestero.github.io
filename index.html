    <h3 style="color:rgb(170, 92, 46);">About me</h3>
    <p>Born in Spain, raised in both Spain and France (near Switzerland), and having lived many years in the United Kindgom for the last half of my studies 
      -- covering audio engineering, physics and more specifically acoustics -- I got the opportunity to learn from many subjects and work on many projects.</p>

      <p>I graduated with an MSc in Architectural Acoustics at <a href="https://www.lsbu.ac.uk/study/course-finder/environmental-architectural-acoustics-msc">
        London South Bank University (LSBU)</a>, U.K., with my end-of-year
      project focusing on a <a href="assets/docs/ICSV24_EBallestero_T12SS3.pdf">Virtual Reality implementation</a> of pre-computed impulse responses of the roman theatre of Arles, France, which could ultimately 
      be fed into a binaural audio signal processing framework made between Max/MSP and the game engine Unity. Today, such processes are well integrated 
      through various <a href="https://resonance-audio.github.io/resonance-audio/">plugins</a> made by major actors of the video game industry.</p>

    <p>In the years that followed, my <a href="assets/docs/EB_PhDThesis_compressed.pdf">PhD research</a> at LSBU, with close collaboration with the
      <a href="https://laum.univ-lemans.fr/fr/index.html">Laboratory of Acoustics of the University of Le Mans (LAUM)</a>, lead me to work 
      on ultra-thin acoustic metamaterials for diffusing sound 
      -- <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-05710-5">metadiffusers</a> -- that could overcome the engineering constraints of traditional
      acoustic treatments (mainly thickness) in view of overhauling the acoustic conditions of performing musicians at 
      the <a href="https://www.roh.org.uk/">Royal Opera House, Covent Garden</a>, London. Not only did these structures <a href="https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5114877">perfomed well</a> under very thin dimension constraints (14 times thinner), 
      but they also showed <a href="https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/5.0053413">great flexibility</a> in terms of effective sound diffusion for large frequency ranges. I also worked 
      with the <a href="http://www.acoustics.ed.ac.uk/">Acoustics & Audio Group</a> of the University of Edinburgh, U.K., on the 
      <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/11/17/8084">numerical implementation</a> of such structures into state-of-the-art acoustic simulations for determining virtually the effect 
      these would have on specific room geometries, such as orchestra pits.
    </p>

    <p>During my first two post-doctoral years, I was a researcher at LAUM, working for the 
      <a href="https://www.cnrs.fr/fr/page-daccueil">National Centre of Scientific Research (CNRS)</a>, where I specialised in 
      passive acoustic metamaterials for controlling wave propagation. More specifically, I was working on the design of a multi-functional 
      passive acoustic metamaterial in a National Research Agency (ANR) project titled <a href="https://anr.fr/Project-ANR-18-CE08-0021">METARoom</a> 
      for designing a passivity-induced optimal deep-subwavelength reconfigurable acoustic metamaterial for room acoustic purposes, with configurations varying between very absorptive to non-absorbing but very diffusing. I also did a one-month visit in the context of a collaboration with the 
      <a href="www.i3m.upv.es">Institute of Instrumentation for Molecular Imaging (I3M)</a> of the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC) at the 
      Polytechnic University of Valencia, concerning the design of ultrasound lenses for biomedical applications.</p>

    <p>Now, while still working at LAUM, I begin a one year and a half post-doctoral journey (at least) in collaboration 
      with fellow biologists at the 
      <a href="https://www.lipme.fr/">LIPME</a>  and  <a href="https://miat.inrae.fr/">MIAT</a> laboratories of the 
      <a href="https://www.inrae.fr/en"> National Research Institute in Agronomy and Environment (INRAE) </a> in Toulouse, France, 
      and with <a href="https://iumpa.webs.upv.es/">University Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics (IUMPA)</a> at the 
      Polytechnic University of Valencia, Spain.</p>
      In this collaboration, we explore how certain plant hair cells (i.e. trichomes)
      could borrow some physical phenomena usually linked to periodic media, such as sonic crystals or metamaterials, even though their apparent disordered distribution. Such phenomena would
      help engage a biological auto-immune response of the plant when it is being subjectted to mechanical activity linked to herbivory.
    </p>

    <p>On parallel, I am also the co-founder and treasurer of the <a href="https://yram.org/">Young Researchers in Acoustic Metamaterials (YRAM)</a> association, 
      a network dedicated to PhD candidates and ECIs (Early Career Investigators) working on acoustic and elastic metamaterials and aiming at 
      enhancing collaborations and co-working between young researchers in this field. Since 2018, our main goal is to organise a 3 day-long international 
      <a href="events.html">Symposium on Acoustic Metamaterials (SAM)</a> each year, as well as co-organizing training schools on these topics.</p>
